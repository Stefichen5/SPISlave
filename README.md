I implemented a terribly simple SPI Slave in VHDL because I needed it for a project I was working on.

For now, it support only 8 bit words with the most significant bit being sent first and the least significant one being sent last.

It comes with a testbed for the DE1SoC board. I tested it and it works for me.

No guarantees for this implementation working, being a good example or anything else.
